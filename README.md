# Interactive-Decision-Trees
This repository contains modules in Python and Jupyter Lab Notebooks for Interactive Construction and analysis of Decision Trees (DT). Python modules provide functions that enable users to incorporate their domain knowledge by interacting with the DT (e.g. manually change split points) and the InteractiveDecisionTrees Jupyter Lab notebook provides basic user-interface options for interacting with the DT for those who don't like programming. The online documentation for Interactive Decision Trees can be found here: (put link)
