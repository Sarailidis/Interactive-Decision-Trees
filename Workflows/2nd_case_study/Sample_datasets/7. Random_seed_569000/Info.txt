Derivation of iDT:
Changes to nodes thresholds:
Node 1  (of SOT DT): From Pm<=431.805 to Pm<=250 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 5, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 7)
Node 2 (of last modified tree): From Pm<=85.589 to Pm<=62.5 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 2, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 4)


Manually change nodes thresholds:
Node 8  (of the last modified tree)
Node 21 (of the last pruned tree)
