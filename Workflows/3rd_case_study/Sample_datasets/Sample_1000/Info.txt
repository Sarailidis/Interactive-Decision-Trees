iDT:
Accuracy - train = 0.743
Accuracy - test  = 0.652

Derivation of iDT:
Changes to features and/or thresholds to split:
Node 1  (of the SOT): From Pm<=178.95 to Pm<=300 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 2, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 7)
Node 5  (of the last modified tree): From LAI_max<=7.652 to Vr<=200 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 4, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 4)
Node 13 (of the last modified tree): From AI<=0.733 to Pm<=500 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 2, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 2)
Node 20 (of the last modified tree): From LAI_max<=7.652 to Ip<=7.0 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 2, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 2)

Manual pruning:
Node 21 (of the last modified tree)

Changing leaf nodes classes to C2:
Node 4  (of the last pruned tree)
Node 21 (of the last pruned tree)
