Derivation of iDT:
Changes to features and/or thresholds to split:
Node 0  (of the SOT): From Pm<=207.12 to Pm<=720 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 22, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 7)
Node 2  (of the last modified tree): From Ip<=8.294 to Pm<=65 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 2, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 7)
Node 33 (of the last modified tree): From AI<=0.553 to Pm<=500 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 4, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 8)
Node 34 (of the last modified tree): From a<=1.94 to ro_P_E<=-0.4 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 2, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 2)
Node 34 (of the last modified tree): From a<=2.178 to Ip<=7 (Max_leaf_nodes_left = 5, Max_leaf_nodes_right = 2)


Manual pruning:
Node 16 (of the last modified tree)
Node 5 (of the last pruned tree)

Changing leaf nodes classes to C2:
Node 28  (of the last pruned tree)
Node 48 (of the last pruned tree)
